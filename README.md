###### 2. Pull the origin (Fetch all the changes made in the main branch in your new branch)
###### 3. Once you are done coding, commit new changes in your branch.
###### 4. Publish the new branch and create a pull request.
###### 5. Pull request from new branch to main (master) branch.

**IMPORTANT**
